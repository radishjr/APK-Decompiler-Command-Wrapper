APK Decompiler Batch

A simple batch wrapper of apktools, dex2jar and JDGUI to make decompiler simpler.

*7zip is required. Please download it from http://www.7-zip.org/ and finish the installation.

Download the whole reposity to your PC and unzip it. Open decompile.bat and replace set 7zipPath="C:\Program Files (x86)\7-Zip\7z.exe" with your own 7zip path.
Then you can run the decompile.bat, input the values and get the decompiled results.
